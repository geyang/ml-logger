- Does Tensorboard feel slow to you?
- Do you have trouble managing hundreds of runs, and 20 different experiments?
- Does the Protobuff that tensorboardX uses feel too opaque, and hard to read from for analysis?

**I do**. This is why I wrote ML-Logger and a ML-Dash, two open-source distributed logging and visualization library for you, and your University collaborators who want to work on the same code!

To get started:

.. code:: bash

    pip install ml-logger ml-dash
    python -m ml_dash.app

::

    /Users/david/berkeley/packages/ml_logger/ml-dash-server/ml_dash/client-dist

        You can now view ml-dash client in the browser.

          Local: 'http://localhost:3001/

        To update to the newer version, do
        ~> pip install --upgrade ml-dash

ML-Logger
=========

- Saves all data in a folder structure (S3 and other backend coming soon)
- Built-in support Tensorflow + pyTorch
- Fast, extremely so
- Logging API that has standardized over 1 and half year of development
- battled hardened -- was handling 3000 rps on a single server
- Support saving in pickle and numpy formats

Log it, and read it later for Analysis!
========================================

supports two way communication between the job and the instrumentation server. Want to run some analysis on a model trained last week? No problem! just do

.. code:: python

    logger.load_module(<NNModule>, key="username/project/run-id/models/blah.pkl").

Fast and Furious
=================


Did I mention that ML-Logger is uber-fast? We make the IO requests asynchronously, so that you main code doesn't slow down. We also support local metrics cache, so that you only send the summary of the metrics :).

Oh, for logging videos, we first compress the frame tensor 200x. And we support live plotting with Matplotlib!

ML-Dash

A Visualization Dashboard designed from ground up, to replace Tensorboard and Visdom.

Pictures are worth a thousand words--see below!

RoadMap
--------

- Adding support for custom Viewers, so that you add custom views specific for your project, such as webGL rendered 3D mesh.
